# Ansible Collection: automatesql.mssql

This collection provides a suite of powerful Ansible roles for the complete, automated lifecycle management of Microsoft SQL Server on Windows. It is designed to be idempotent, flexible, and scalable, handling everything from initial installation to ongoing maintenance like patching.

This collection will grow over time to include more roles for comprehensive SQL Server administration.
